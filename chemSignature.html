                                How have you grown as a student? This semester I have grown
                                because I have learned to be better with my time management,
                                being better with my time has allowed me to receive better scores
                                and my stress with school has been minimized.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                What brought about those improvements? At the beginning of the
                                semester, I set goals and expectations for myself to achieve and
                                that is what really motivated me and helped me to improve.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                What new study skills and strategies have you embraced that you
                                will take with you to other learning environments? Every day I set
                                aside time for each class I had, and I created a weekly schedule/
                                plan for myself so I could stay on track. Having a to do list really
                                helped me stay focused. I will continue to plan and create
                                schedules to follow to help with other classes. Another thing that
                                has really helped me with my studies was I have become a better
                                researcher and I am now able to read texts in a more beneficial
                                way.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Connect these skills and strategies with specific activities,
                                assignments, or readings. Critical chemistry was a helpful resource
                                for me this semester really helped me thoroughly read the texts
                                provided. I also really enjoyed the quizzes we took and how they
                                were provided with a reading to go over before the quiz and that we
                                could refer to it while taking the quiz.
                            </li>

                        <li><b>Reflect on your new perspective regarding the world around you</b></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                How has your view of the world around you changed or been
                                enhanced? I now understand the chemical reason behind
                                phenomenon and chemistry is more a part of my daily life than I
                                ever realized before this class. I will now better understand how the
                                world around me works because of chemistry.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                What new connections have you made because of your experience
                                in this class? I know understand chemical reactions better and that
                                chemistry is related to all things, math, cooking, cleaning, weather,
                                our bodies, and nutrition.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                In what ways, large and small, do you see the world differently
                                now? I think chemistry has had a large impact on how I see the
                                world differently, I now understand the how and why behind things,
                                now when I see things, I will be able to look at it with a chemistry
                                background/understanding.
                            </li>

                                Cite specific experiences in this course that prompted these
                                changes. I really enjoyed the signature assignment and abstract

                                assignment, it allowed me to research on topics that interested me
                                and look at the chemical reason behind topics I was fascinated by.
                                That helped me want to learn more about chemistry because I was
                                able to apply it to my likes and personalize my learning about the
                                topic.

                        Biology is the study of life, life is extremely valued by society, so therefore biology is
important to society. Biology gives humanity an understanding of how life works, how it is
formed, it explains the changes of life and the environment. Biology influences everything
including human and animal health, reproduction, quality of life, nutrition, and most parts of
our everyday life that you could think of. Biology helps us understand how we should take care
of ourselves, animals, crops/plants, and our planet. We only have this one life. It is essential to
know how to maximize our life, to make the most of our opportunity here and live long,
healthy, happy, lives and help others to do so as well. We all enjoy our fury little friends and the
great outdoors; it is vital for us to understand how to care for the Earth to protect the place we
all call home.
                        <p>
                            <br />
                            Biology goes in depth and explains the existence of all forms of life. Biology is hugely
                            important to human health because it provides us with knowledge of our anatomy. The study
                            of humans physical and chemical processes and the explanation of how it all functions together
                            is anatomy. Biology is why we study the origin of disease, it’s how we discover infections,
                            functional problems, causes for diseases, prevention for diseases, side effects, treatments,
                            cures, and antidotes to these diseases. Medicine was discovered because of biology and the
                            helpful affects were learned. Human reproduction would be more challenging without the
                            study of biology. Biology helps finds methods that fix reproduction problems, birth defects, and
                            even inform couples of genetic risks their future child may have. Biology is key to understanding
                            human development and knowledge on how to enhance important human traits.

                        <p>
                            Biology is important to agriculture, our food source. Biology discovers new agriculture
breeds and plants that will improve the nutritional value of our food. When countries
experience food shortage, biology is utilized to develop resourceful and long-lasting ways to
produce more food.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            Our environment is what provides us with shelter and a home and that is why there is
such an importance placed on persevering our home. The irony behind this is humans are many
of the reasons behind the environmental problems. The air, water, soil, and animals are
endangered because of our behavior and habits. The simplest actions humans make can either
help the environment or have an irrevocable impact on the life on earth. To be able to limit the
negative impacts we are creating on the environment, biology needs to be studied. To
understand the environment biologist, study the link between living things, and the place they
live in. Biologist will travel the world researching, comparing, analyzing collecting data on the
effects of phenomena, like global warming for one example.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            Biology is constantly researching environmental factors that could threaten us, our food,
                            animals, the atmosphere, and the earth. Biology helps us manage the environment and aid in
                            new discoveries to keep the lands and oceans clean and safe. Overall, the knowledge from
                            biology is what helps prolong all life forms and is always looking for new ways to improve the
                            quality of life for all.

                        <p>I am glad I took biology and I learned more from taking this course than I ever expected.
                            Not only did I learn a lot from this course, but I also learned things that I will stick with me
                            forever. Most general education courses I have taken, I tend to forget the teachings over time,
                            but I am certain biology will have a lasting effect on my way of thinking. After taking this biology
                            course it has sparked my interest in biology and has left me wanting to dive into more biology
                            classes and expand my knowledge about biology further. Taking this biology course, I learned
                            and mastered many things. Some of those skills that I have mastered while taking this course
                            was time management, efficient study skills, and reading texts. I have become a better test
                            taker and I have really grasped the general concept of biology and its importance. I have
                            learned a lot about genetics, and cells which is something that I am sure will be the most
                            important background knowledge for my future career.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            With this class my time management improved. I was able to get everything done on
                            time, sometimes ahead of time and I got rid of procrastination habits. This time management
                            improvement reflected in my course work in several ways. With the absence of procrastination,
                            I was able to really focus on an assignment and take my time and not rush through them, and
                            that helped me receive good scores on the assignments. My stress with this class was
                            nonexistent because I was able to manage my time so efficiently. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Studying has never been my favorite thing in the world but with biology and the topic
being so interesting to me I was able to study with ease. I really enjoyed diving into biology and
researching all about it and there is so much more to biology than I ever realized, it’s a huge
part of life and it goes deep and complex. My improved time management lead to my improved
studying time, my past procrastination got in the way of my homework time which never left
me time to study. Since I was always on schedule that left me time to study. I usually get major
test anxiety and I am a slow taker but with this class I was able to complete the test within the
timed window. Being more prepared with everything made the tests less stressful. Being
prepared also lead to test scores I was happy with.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            This course has helped me become better at reading textbooks and research papers,
usually those types of things leave me feeling sleepy. I am now better at reading information
and being able to dissect it and retain it for my benefit. I am now better about researching
topics and finding answers to my questions quickly. I am sure a lot of my success of this course
could be related to the fact that I really enjoy biology, it’s so much easier to learn about
something you care about and find interesting versus something you are just required to learn
about. In my future courses I’m sure even if I don’t find it interesting, I will do well because I
have created and mastered good learning habits with this course, that is my hope.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            I want to one day be a Speech Pathologist and I am glad I took this course, what I
learned in this course will build a good foundation to my future career. I loved learning about
the cellular level of biology and about genetics that is something that will stick with me in the
next courses I take. Another biology related course I am now excited to take is anatomy, I have
been nervous to take that course but after taking this course I feel more at ease. I am positive
what I learned from this course will make anatomy easier to grasp. Biology wasn’t something I
was expecting to really love, I am glad I was able to discover a new interest of mine. Thanks to
biology I am looking forward to my next science course.

                            My favorite medium to work with is watercolors, my grandmother is an amazing artist, and she has been teaching me how to watercolor. I love watercolors because I love how the colors blend and all the different variations of colors you can make and how pronounced or subtle you can show those colors on the paper. I wish I could share some of her work and what she has been teaching me, but I am currently moving and all that is packed up. Art pieces that inspire me is anything pottery or I love photography I did both those things in high school. I love art, but I have never found myself talent or creative maybe I just need more practice and need to be more disciplined to do that, I think everyone could be creative some may just need more work at it than others. I really appreciate others work and find it inspiring. I always say when I see something beautiful especially in nature, I wish I could capture what my eyes see because I can never get a picture to do it justice so I really appreciate those who can. My boyfriend and I are moving into our new home the end of July and I am already planning on decorating with many beautiful pots and beautiful works of art.

                            Check out this page the artist I like are Lucie Rie, Hans Coper and Jennifer Lee. I like their work because it's very simple, natural and use neutral colors.

                            Wow these are very amazing! They are so detailed and use to many vibrant colors. This caught my eye instantly and I have never seen these things before, so I appreciate you sharing. I agree there are so many different mediums of amazing art, and it is hard to choose just one.

                            Taya I couldn't agree more with you, I love the painting of the mountain it's so simple and beautiful and it also looks so realistic to me it could almost be a photograph. I also loved that you shared 'Nichols Canyon' I love all the colors and the many tiny details I love the way the painting moves up.

                            Art can be and mean many things, it just depends on who you ask, but there is no wrong answer. The purpose of Art is to provide beauty which gives us hope, and comfort by showing us we aren’t alone. Art gives us balance people tend to be more attracted to art that provides them with something that they’re missing and need filled. Art provides the world with something to appreciate, it gives class, luxury, fame, and value to things. Art can be propaganda for important matters, it motivates towards a cause. There are many styles and opinions behind art, art is freedom of speech, art is expression and if someone gives it value and appreciates it others shouldn’t destroy it just because they don’t appreciate it. Not everyone needs to agree on something, that’s the beauty of art there’s something for everyone.

                            Art started out to advertise and express religion specifically Christianity. Throughout time art has evolved into much more than that, now art can be about anything, and it can be used to express, advertise, or promote anything.  Many feel as though modern art is creating trends that are diminishing the importance and “rules” behind classical art. I don’t understand the purpose or beauty behind some modern art, anything that I could easily do myself doesn’t impress me. Art that I find impressive are things that amaze me, things that scream individual talent that is so unique it is hard to copied by others. Something that I couldn’t do myself something that takes time and effort. Art can be expensive, and it needs to be something worth paying for. I may be old fashion in that sense of where I place value on art. This is art I would be willing to pay for, I think it is important to support art you enjoy because that raises the value and that will continue the creation of that art. If you are passionate about art, seek out art you enjoy and support it. Destroying art, you don’t agree with is wrong to others ignore that art and focus on art you love. Art shouldn’t be an argument of right and wrong art should be freedom.

                            Jared, I agree with you I also don't think you need to have a lot of background knowledge to be able to appreciate and enjoy something. Art is so broad it is almost impossible to define, yet it is a simple answer to what art is, it is also not some simple for many people when it is deeply thought out. Art kind of reminds me of religion there so many different kinds and it is hard to define.  I also agree with you we will always be asking what art is and in the future who knows what art is yet to come and what art will stay.

                            I 100% agree Skylar I loved that you said art could never be good or bad, that is so important to me, and many don't think the same way, many want to ban what they don't like, and I find that sad. I liked that you pointed out you aren't obligated to consider everything as art that is also so important to understand. It is fun to try and understand what the artist was trying to say with their art. I am the same way I enjoy many different types of art there is really a rhyme or reason to what I like, it's just what speaks to me.
